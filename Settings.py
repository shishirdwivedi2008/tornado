            <p>The first key to solving a graph related problem is recognizing that it is a graph problem. This can be more difficult than it sounds, because the problem writers don’t usually spell it out for you. Nearly all graph problems will somehow use a grid or network in the problem, but sometimes these will be well disguised. Secondly, if you are required to find a path of any sort, it is usually a graph problem as well. Some common keywords associated with graph problems are: vertices, nodes, edges, connections, connectivity, paths, cycles and direction. An example of a description of a simple problem that exhibits some of these characteristics is:</p>
            <p>Bob has become lost in his neighborhood. He needs to get from his current position back to his home. Bob’s neighborhood is a 2 dimensional grid, that starts at (0, 0) and (width – 1, height – 1). There are empty spaces upon which bob can walk with no difficulty, and houses, which Bob cannot pass through. Bob may only move horizontally or vertically by one square at a time.

            </p>
            <p>Bob’s initial position will be represented by a ‘B’ and the house location will be represented by an ‘H’. Empty squares on the grid are represented by ‘.’ and houses are represented by ‘X’. Find the minimum number of steps it takes Bob to get back home, but if it is not possible for Bob to return home, return -1.</p>
            <p>An example of a neighborhood of width 7 and height 5:</p>

            
            <h2 class="section-heading">Representing a graph and key concepts</h2>
            
            <p>Graphs can represent many different types of systems, from a two-dimensional grid (as in the problem above) to a map of the internet that shows how long it takes data to move from computer A to computer B. We first need to define what components a graph consists of. In fact there are only two, nodes and edges. A node (or vertex) is a discrete position in the graph. An edge (or connection) is a link between two vertices that can be either directed or undirected and may have a cost associated with it. An undirected edge means that there is no restriction on the direction you can travel along the edge. So for example, if there were an undirected edge from A to B you could move from A to B or from B to A. A directed edge only allows travel in one direction, so if there were a directed edge from A to B you could travel from A to B, but not from B to A. An easy way to think about edges and vertices is that edges are a function of two vertices that returns a cost. We will see an example of this methodology in a second.</p>
            <p>For those that are used to the mathematical description of graphs, a graph G = {V, E} is defined as a set of vertices, V, and a collection of edges (which is not necessarily a set), E. An edge can then be defined as (u, v) where u and v are elements of V. There are a few technical terms that it would be useful to discuss at this point as well:</p>
            <p>Order – The number of vertices in a graph Size – The number of edges in a graph</p>

            <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

            <span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>

            <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

            <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
