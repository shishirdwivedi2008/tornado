            <p>First of all, what is Python? According to its creator, Guido van Rossum, Python is a:</p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">"high-level programming language, and its core design philosophy is all about code readability and a syntax which allows programmers to express concepts in a few lines of code"</blockquote>
            <p>For me, the first reason to learn Python was that it is, in fact, a beautiful programming language. It was really natural to code in it and express my thoughts.</p>
            <p>Another reason was that we can use coding in Python in multiple ways: data science, web development, and machine learning all shine here. Quora, Pinterest and Spotify all use Python for their backend web development. So let’s learn a bit about it.</p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">The Basics</h2>
            <p></p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">1. Variables</h2>
            <p>You can think about variables as words that store a value. Simple as that.</p>
            <p>In Python, it is really easy to define a variable and set a value to it. Imagine you want to store number 1 in a variable called “one.” Let’s do it:
            </p>
            <code>one = 1</code>
            <p>How simple was that? You just assigned the value 1 to the variable “one.”</p>
            <pre>
            <code>two = 2
                  some_number = 10000
            </code>
            </pre>
            <p>And you can assign any other value to whatever other variables you want. As you see in the table above, the variable “two” stores the integer 2, and “some_number” stores 10,000.</p>
            <p>Besides integers, we can also use booleans (True / False), strings, float, and so many other data types.</p>
            <pre>
            <code>
            # booleans
            true_boolean = True
            false_boolean = False

            # string
            my_name = "Leandro Tk"

            # float
            book_price = 15.
            </code>
            </pre>

            <h2 class="section-heading">2. Control Flow: conditional statements</h2>
            <p><b>“If”</b> uses an expression to evaluate whether a statement is <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>. If it is <code>True</code>, it executes what is inside the “if” statement. For example:</p>
            <pre>
            <code>  
            if True:
            print("Hello Python If")

            if 2 > 1:
            print("2 is greater than 1")
            </code>
            </pre>
